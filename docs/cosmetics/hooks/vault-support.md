:::info
Vault is an optional dependency for Cosmetics, which means you can use the Cosmetics addon without having Vault.
:::

You may download Vault from Spigot at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/

Vault  will let your players unlock cosmetics with coins and permissions. Using any type of economy or permission plugin that is integrated with Vault is acceptable

Please keep in mind that, the permissions are checked by the Bukkit API by default, when there is no Vault permission plugin installed.

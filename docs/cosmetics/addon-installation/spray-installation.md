This is merely an additional criterion for Spray category; you do not need to completely re-setup each arena.

## Spray Item Frames Installation

Unlike other cosmetic categories, Spray necessitates some modifications to each of your BedWars1058 arenas.

Set up the item frames for each arena by following the steps below.

1. To disable the arena, run the command `/bw disableArena arena>.`
2. Run `/bw setupArena arena>` to edit the arena after that.
3. After that, you must put item frames in each arena, anywhere you want (try to put at least two item frames for each team island).
4. Once you've completed everything, just type `/bw save` to save the arena, and you're all set.

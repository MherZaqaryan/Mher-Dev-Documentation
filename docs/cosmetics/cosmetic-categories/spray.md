## What is Spray?

Sprays are pictures that are being shown whenever a player clicks on the spray slots that are located on every spawn island and some center islands.

There are over 41+ in-built sprays associated with the addon, you can add more sprays manually with a couple of steps, also you may use the [Developer API](/cosmetics/developer-api/getting-started) to add your desired Spray as well.

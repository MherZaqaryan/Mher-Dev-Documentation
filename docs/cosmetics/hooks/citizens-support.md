:::info
Citizens is used to activate the [Shopkeeper Skin](/cosmetics/cosmetic-categories/shopkeeper-skin) category, however Cosmetics is still usable without Citizens.
:::

Citizens is an NPC plugin and basically a dependency for Cosmetics addon, which with Cosmetics will activate its [Shopkeeper Skin](/cosmetics/cosmetic-categories/shopkeeper-skin) category.

The plugin is semi-premium, check out the links below.

You may purchase the plugin from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/13811/) or download it from [CitizensNPCs](https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Citizens2/)

Citizens compatibility is still in progress, and there are some known issues yet.

## Command Function

For the categories and cosmetics* menu you may add some items which will run a command when a player clicks on it.

### Player
To make the command run by the player who clicked, you can just simply put your command in the `command: example` config section.

### Console
To make the command run by the console, you have to use the form of `CONSOLE:command` in the `command: CONSOLE:example` config section. You may use **`{player}`** placeholder which will be replaced by the player's name who clicked the item.

### Close
To make the click close the inventory use `CLOSE` identifier for the command section.


## Material

:::tip
Use materials from useful resources for your server version.
:::

### Amount
To set an amount for an item use `amount: 1` config section. The maximum amount is 64.

### Enchantment
To make an item enchanted you can set `enchanted: false` the config section from **false** to **true**.

### Data
To use data for material for only 1.8x-1.12x you can use the form of `material:data` for example `WOOL:5` will be lime wool. Otherwise use the full material name for example `LIME_WOOL`.

### Custom Textured Player Head
To make a textured player head you must use the form of `texture:base64` for example:

<details>

<summary>Example of custom texture head</summary>

Example: `Material: texture:eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvZjk4YmM2M2YwNWY2Mzc4YmYyOWVmMTBlM2Q4MmFjYjNjZWI3M2E3MjBiZjgwZjMwYmM1NzZkMGFkOGM0MGNmYiJ9fX0=`

### Fill Empty Slots
To fill the empty slots of the Categories, Cosmetics, and Confirm Purchase menus you have to change the empty-slots path's `enabled: false` section to **true**, to make it fill all the slots which are empty. You may change the material of the filling item. 

## Sounds

:::tip
Use sounds from useful resources for your server version.

You can configure sounds volume and pitch by using the form of `sound:volume:pitch` for example `NOTE_PLING:1:2` this plays **NOTE_PLING** sound with volume of *1* and pitch of *2*.

## Rarities

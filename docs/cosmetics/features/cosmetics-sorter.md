This is a feature to sort cosmetics in various ways. It is available in each cosmetic category menu.

Sorting methods are:
- *Lowest rarity first*
- *Highest rarity first*
- *A to Z*
- *Z to A*

Additionally, the player can select (by right-clicking) whether or not the owned cosmetics are displayed first.

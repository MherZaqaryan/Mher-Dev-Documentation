## What is Projectile Trail?
Projectile Trail is a visual effect that adds animation over the projectile (arrow or fireball) whenever the player shoots it.

There are 35+ in-built projectile trails available in this addon, however, you can add some more by using the [Developer API](/cosmetics/developer-api/getting-started), there is no way to add a projectile trail manually from the configuration file.
